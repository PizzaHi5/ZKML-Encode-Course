I followed the guide specificed in the homework 7 docs. 

I took notes in hw7 folder while going thru this process. Here are the notes:
Model name is: linear_regression
[giza][2024-04-08 10:41:27.073] Model Created with id -> 489! ✅
[giza][2024-04-08 10:41:27.856] Version Created with id -> 1! ✅
[giza][2024-04-08 10:41:27.856] Sending model for transpilation ✅
Endpoint is successful ✅
[giza][2024-04-08 10:44:22.997] Endpoint created with id -> 130 ✅

'gize workspaces get' returned an error. Workspace not found
Perform inferences @:
https://endpoint-pizzahi5-489-1-74c88db6-7i3yxzspbq-ew.a.run.app
I reran the commands and got it working however I did not get an output proof-id

I needed to add a print line to get the Proof_id since it was not printing that output for me to reference in the next steps.
My proof_id is: ed089efea4fc415f8b7c94f8f966a1ec
Task Completed here: https://actions-server-pizzahi5-dblzzhtf5q-ew.a.run.app/flow-runs/flow-run/d463db40-406c-4d9b-9f60-7d59afd061af

Got the proof downloaded using the command below:
giza endpoints download-proof --endpoint-id 130 --proof-id ed089efea4fc415f8b7c94f8f966a1ec --output-path zklr.proof

Proof of Inference Complete for the linear regression model! WOOT WOOT!

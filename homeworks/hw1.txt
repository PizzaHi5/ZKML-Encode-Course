Multiplicative inverses
For the set S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
What is
a) 3 x 5
    p = 7;
    3 x 5 = 15mod7 = 1

b) The multiplicative inverse of 3 ?
    Applying fermats little theoreum,
    a = 3;
    p = 7;
    3^5 = 243mod7 = 5


Polynomials

Find a positive root
    r = 3

What is the degree of this polynomial ?
    Degree = 3

Rewrite this in the form
(x − a).Q(x)
